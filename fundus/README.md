# Reproducing Results for Retina Fundus Gender Classification Models

This directory contains resources and scripts to reproduce the results from the retina fundus gender prediction project. Follow the instructions below to run the respective models.

## Models and Instructions

### 1. Train, Validation, and Test Split Model w/ Ensembling
- **File:** `retina_fundus_train_val_test.ipynb`  
- **Description:** Runs the model with data split into train, validation, and test sets. Includes visualizations
of the data and results, and ensembling of models for improved performance. 
- **Steps to Run:**  
  1. Open the notebook in Google Colab: `retina_fundus_train_val_test.ipynb`.  
  2. Execute the cells sequentially to generate and validate the train/test split results.
